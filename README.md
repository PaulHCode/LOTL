# Overview
This module is comprised of cmdlets written in PowerShell to help teach basic system administration and security scripting. These same system administration tools are often the same ones needed and used for living off the land. I plan to write this module while teaching others how to write PowerShell. I'm considering items listed below but may change what I release depending on feedback from colleagues. The intent is to be small fairly easy cmdlets written entirely in PowerShell (and a few dotnet calls if needed).
